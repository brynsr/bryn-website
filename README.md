# A1: Responsive Design System - u3230043

Throughout this unit so far, the importance of well designed, universal website design has been stressed. It was important for both the assessment, and my personal understanding in developing projects for HTML5 that I focus on making sure that I develop a stable, easily customisable, and universally accessible website in order to allow for the site to be used by all audiences and users.

For this website, I focused on trying to provide the best user experience across all platforms without compromising on the design aesthetic or interfering with functionality.  In order to ensure the website displays correctly on smaller devices, I made consistent use of CSS rules such as the @media property to find the page’s ‘breaking point’ for functionality.  By specifying a screen width with @media and setting parameters for an altered layout, it’s possible to completely customise a site for a different screen size and position layout.  I used this function to change the layout once reaching 880 pixels by setting the layout to an inline display type and scaling all elements to fill the screen.  As a result, my page scales well to small and large display resolutions alike.

My future implementations of the @media property would include additional different sizes and a more diverse range of layouts which would be optimal for any device that can access the page. 

Another way that I have ensured the site will be viewable on multiple device types is through the scale units which I have chosen. Percentage units will scale the element relative to the viewport, and em/rem units will scale relative to the standard font size in the overall <html> element. By using these units of measurement, the scale of objects will always be relative to the screen size. 

An additional consideration I made when developing the site was optimising the page for screen readers. It was important to make sure that I used alt text for the hero image, and providing <section> and <div> tags which where properly layered ensures that the site is more accessible above simply displaying on multiple displays.

Overall, I have provided a clean, simple, and customisable layout which can scale to any device screen, and the site is developed with correct syntax and markdown structure which is to be expected of a well-developed HTML page.
